# CarNumberPlateDetection


**We have used yolo v3 to find bounding box of number in image and for segmentation we used open cv image processing techniques to clean the image
and finally used EasyOcr library for predicting plate number
outputimages is folder which conatins all the plate images in a image**

# Features-
## 1.our model can work on videos but its quite slow due to expensive computation. 
## 2.It can handle rotated number plate
## 3.Can Extract number plate from car image and then segment it and predict car plate number
## 4.It automatically filters noise in background
